# The HexBahPyr Color Space Converter: RGB / HSL / HSI / HEX (2) to RGBW 

## A piece of emergent tooling

> The product of 7 years of LED projects, which solves a simple problem- converting commonly used color space representations to be able to tbe translated to RGBW for use with RGBW LEDs (you won't believe the pastels RGBW makes possible).

## Authors

Too numerous to list.  This library was pulled out of pyramidscheme/pyramidtriagles, which was a fork of the original pyramid triagnles, which was a port of the bitbucket repo which controlled the original BAAAHS light systems, which itself was built from a doundation the original LED installation collective, HEX, wrote for controlling much of their early work.  Honorable mentions however go to Gbrn (for writing the majority of the bones) and Brian Nettler (for having worked out the transform to RGBW and publishing it openly-  see source for references).

## Intention

To make this bite sized and easy to use, stripping out any cruft and trying to make it as broadly compatible with at least most of python 3 versions.  Python 2.7 compatibility is not too much of a stretch to sort out for anyone who wants to fork that.
